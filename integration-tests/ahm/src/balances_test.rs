//! Test that balances are migrated correctly.
//!
//! This is additional to the tests in the AH and RC migrator pallets. Those tests check that the
//! state of the relay chain and asset hub are consistent before and after migration, with special
//! focus on the checking balance. The tests consider jointly the state of the relay chain and asset
//! hub, making sure that balance is not burned or created out of thin air.
//!
//! NOTE: These tests should be written in the E2E chopsticks framework, but since that is not up
//! yet, they are here. This test is also very simple, it is not generic and just uses the Runtime
//! types directly.
