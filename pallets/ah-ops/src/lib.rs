//! The operational pallet for the Asset Hub, designed to manage and facilitate the migration of
//! subsystems such as Governance, Staking, Balances from the Relay Chain to the Asset Hub. This
//! pallet works alongside its counterpart, `pallet_rc_migrator`, which handles migration
//! processes on the Relay Chain side.
//!
//! This pallet is responsible for controlling the initiation, progression, and completion of the
//! migration process, including managing its various stages and transferring the necessary data.
//! The pallet directly accesses the storage of other pallets for read/write operations while
//! maintaining compatibility with their existing APIs.
//!
//! To simplify development and avoid the need to edit the original pallets, this pallet may
//! duplicate private items such as storage entries from the original pallets. This ensures that the
//! migration logic can be implemented without altering the original implementations.
