	/// Translate account from RC format to AH format.

	/// implementation with the real one.
	/// TODO introduce different accountId types for RC and AH e.g something like
	/// ```rust
	/// trait IntoAhTranslated<AhAccountId> {
	///     fn into_ah_translated(self) -> AhAccountId;
	/// }
	/// ```
	/// where RC::AccountId would implement IntoAhTranslated<AH::AccountId>
